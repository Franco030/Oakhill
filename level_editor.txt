If I want to add one more obstacle I need to edit these things

We would need to have the new class of the new Obstacle already made in the Obstacles script
The majority of walls will have the type be "Fence" until I fix that problem



---------- NOT ANYMORE ---------- 

1. Go to Scene_Loader script and add one more check to check te new obstacle
2. In the level_editor script modify the dictionary "obstacle_types"
3. Make a list of image indexes of the new obstacle
4. Modify the UI text so that the it'll be "Press 1-Tree 2-Rock 3-Wall 4-NewObstacle
5. Make a new event in the event loop inside the main loop, "pygame.K_4 -> NewObstacle"
6. Modify the save state so that my new object is saved
7. Modify the event MOUSEBUTTONDOWN (event.button == 1) to add the new object there "obj["type] == NewObstacle"

---------- UPDATES ----------

Now there's a dictionary with the event configuration for each obstacle added
1. Go to level_editor and edit that dictionary to apply the configuration for the obstacle.
2. Go to the Scene_Loader and edit the dictionary there to match the one in level_editor.


Enemies are not yet added to the level_editor, and may never be added
